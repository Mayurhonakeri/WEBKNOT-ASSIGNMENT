User Query:
"i want you to help me out with the assignment and provide me the necessary resources that i require to build a successful backend with some necessary steps "

AI Analysis & Response:
- Requirements Extraction: Identified core assignment components from attached PDF
  - Multi-college support (50 colleges, ~500 students each, ~20 events/semester)
  - Event lifecycle management (creation → registration → attendance → feedback)
  - Reporting system with specific report types
  - Database design with proper relationships
  - API implementation with comprehensive endpoints

- Architecture Decision: Chose Node.js + Express.js + SQLite stack
  - Rationale: Balanced complexity vs. deliverability for assignment context
  - Differentiation Strategy: Created unique implementation distinct from previous versions


 Phase 2: System Architecture & Implementation 
Objective: Building core system components



Database Design:
Tables Created: Colleges → Students → Events → Registrations → Attendance → Feedback
Relationships: Proper foreign keys with cascade handling
Constraints: Unique indexes, capacity limits, rating validations


API Structure:
- RESTful endpoints following industry standards
- Comprehensive CRUD operations for all entities
- Advanced filtering and pagination
- Bulk operations for administrative efficiency

Business Logic Implementation:
- Capacity management with waitlist functionality
- Attendance tracking with multiple states (Present/Absent/Late)
- Feedback system with 1-5 star ratings and detailed comments
- Cross-college event support with data isolation

 User Feedback Integration:
- Real-time adjustments based on user testing
- Port configuration changes (5000 → 3001)
- UI enhancement requests incorporated
- Data structure refinements

 Phase 3: Visual Output Generation & Testing 
Objective: Creating demonstration materials and validation

 Visual Assets Created:
1. Server Startup Console - Professional terminal output with status messages
2. API Response Examples - JSON data showing colleges, events, students
3. Dashboard Interface - Modern web UI with statistics and navigation
4. Reporting Outputs - Comprehensive analytics and data visualization
5. Database Seeding Results - Realistic sample data with proper relationships

 Phase 4: Data Enhancement & Customization 
Objective: Personalizing system with realistic Indian context

Progressive Enhancement Requests:
1. Initial: Basic event data modification
2. Refinement: Addition of Indian college names and student names
3. Specification: Focus on IIT Delhi with specific events (Web Development, AI/ML, Cultural)
4. Final Enhancement: Comprehensive student analytics with ratings and participation metrics

 Data Quality Improvements:
